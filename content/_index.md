# Hello World

Hi, I am Marvin and this will be a blog about stuff I do. No monetization, no ads, only garbage I like.

This includes:
- Programming (mainly in Rust but possibly in Lua and Python. Because of my studies, probably Pascal, Java, C and C++ too.)
- Radio (Meshtastic, SDR, CB, HAM Radio (AFU). I would also like to put one, or two, ... or three radios into my car (which I do not yet have because I am a brokie))
- My studies at FH-OOE University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria (Software Engineering)
- and other things (Car repairs?)

I want this blog to go quite technical, but there will be some higher level posts that just give a nice overview.

After I get a valid TLS certificate so I can serve you juicy HTTPS content, although HTTP will stay available for you to use, I will start to upload posts.

I would also prefer if the DNS finally catches up and resolves my [domain](marvins-frequency.com) properly.

Have a great day and we will hear us soon! (Not quite hear but you know what I mean.)
