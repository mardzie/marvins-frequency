This blog post is more for me as a cheatsheet but feel free to read along.

This post is based on [How to write technical blog posts - talk by Quincy Larson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YODPgBadj80&list=TLPQMTEwMTIwMjYp3fQ7HejUNA).

# Substance is everything
Buzzwords won't save you.
In order to write good blog posts, you need to have knowledge about the topic.

# Different levels of experience

New variations make the deal.
If there isn't one for a language, write it.
But don't repeat the same topic too often.

Don't just write for noobs or experts.
The middle ground is under blogged.

# Writing good blog posts is time-consuming

I noticed this too.
The video is only 16:00 minutes long but I am writing for over 2 hours.

# Packaging is important
Packaging makes a post interesting.

What is packaging?
- A Headline
- Images
- Formatting
- Platform (I only have one: **This Blog** 🎉)

## A good headline is nearly everything
No one clicks on a boring headline.
Make them good!

## Images
Humans are highly visual.

Use images to your advantage.
There are many creative commons images out there.

## No wall of text

You need nice short paragraphs and sentences.

Shorter isn't dumber.

# Conclusion
1)  Create substance
2) Package for consumption
3) Advertise :(

and most importantly, have fun!

Thanks for reading, see you next time.
